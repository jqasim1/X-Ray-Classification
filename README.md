# X-Ray-Classification

This is the class challenge for the CS440 Class Challenge. 
Extracting the zip file with the data gives two folders. One called "two", that is used for binary classification, and another called "all", used for multi-class classification. The data can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kfbClpI9p2zYLPEvWBBdawyOwhXybsBa/view?usp=sharing
